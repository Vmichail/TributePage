      <h3 id="headline">Chester Bennington life summary:</h3>
      <li><strong>Early life</strong> -- Chester Charles Bennington was born on March 20, 1976, in Phoenix, Arizona.
      His mother was a nurse, while his father was a police detective who worked on child sexual abuse cases.</li>
      <u><strong>Music career</strong></u>
      <li><strong>Early acts</strong> - Bennington first began singing with a band called Sean Dowdell and His Friends? They released an eponymous three-track cassette in 1993.
         Later, Dowdell and Bennington moved on to form a new band, Grey Daze, a post-grunge band from Phoenix, Arizona.
         The band recorded three albums: Demo in 1993, Wake/Me in 1994, and ...no sun today in 1997.
          Bennington left Grey Daze in 1998, but struggled to find another band.</li>
      <li><strong>Linkin Park</strong> - Bennington was frustrated and almost ready to quit his musical career altogether when Jeff Blue,
         the vice president of artists and repertoire at Zomba Music in Los Angeles, 
         offered him an audition with the future members of Linkin Park.
          Bennington quit his day job at a digital services firm[6] and took his family to California, where he had a successful audition with Linkin Park,
           who were then called Xero.
           He managed to record the song for his audition in a day, missing his own birthday celebration in the process.
            Bennington and Mike Shinoda, the band's other vocalist, made significant progress together, but failed to find a record deal.
            After facing numerous rejections, Blue, now a vice president of artists and repertoire at Warner Bros.,
             intervened again to help the band sign with Warner Bros. Records.</li>
      <li><strong>Dead by Sunrise</strong> - Bennington co-founded Dead by Sunrise, an electronic rock band from Los Angeles, California, 
        with Orgy and Julien-K members Amir Derakh and Ryan Shuck in 2005.[19][20] Dead by Sunrise made their live debut in May 2008, performing four songs
         at the 13th anniversary party for Club Tattoo in Tempe, Arizona.
       The band released their debut album Out of Ashes on October 13, 2009.</li>
      <li><strong>Stone Temple Pilots</strong> - In February 2013, Stone Temple Pilots parted ways with long-time lead singer Scott Weiland.
         The band recruited Bennington to replace Weiland in May 2013. On May 18, 2013, Bennington took the stage at KROQ's Weenie Roast with the band.
        The setlist included original Stone Temple Pilots songs, as well as their first single with Bennington on vocals called "Out of Time", 
        which debuted on May 19 and was available for free download via their official website.
         It was later announced by Chester and the band in an exclusive KROQ interview that he was officially the new frontman of Stone Temple Pilots and discussed the possibility
        of a new album and tour.
         The song "Out of Time" is featured on their EP High Rise, which was released on October 8, 2013</li>
      <u><strong>Personal life</strong></u>
      <li><strong>Relationshops and children</strong> - Bennington had a child, Jaime (born May 12, 1996), 
        from his relationship with Elka Brand.[25] In 2006, he adopted Brand's other son, Isaiah[25] (born November 8, 1997).
         He married his first wife, Samantha Marie Olit, on October 31, 1996.[26] They had one child together,
        Draven Sebastian (born April 19, 2002).[25] Bennington's relationship with his first wife declined during his early years with Linkin Park,
         and they divorced in 2005. In 2006, he married Talinda Ann Bentley,
         a former Playboy model with whom he had three children:
        Tyler Lee Bennington (born March 16, 2006) and twins Lilly and Lila (born November 6, 2011).[28]</li>
      <li><strong>Interests</strong> - Bennington was a tattoo enthusiast.[30] He had done work and promotions with Club Tattoo, a tattoo parlor in Tempe, Arizona. Club Tattoo is owned by Sean Dowdell, Bennington's friend since high school with whom he played in two bands.
     Bennington was a fan of the Phoenix Suns, Arizona Cardinals, Arizona Diamondbacks, and Arizona Coyotes.[35]</li>
      <u><strong>Death</strong></u>
      <li><strong>Suicide</strong> - Bennington was found dead at his home in Palos Verdes Estates,
         California; his housekeeper discovered his body around 9:00 a.m. PDT on July 20, 2017.His death was ruled a suicide.
          Mike Shinoda confirmed his death on Twitter, writing, "Shocked and heartbroken, but it's true.
           An official statement will come out as soon as we have one".
        On July 21, Brian Elias, the chief of operations for the office of the medical examiner-coroner, confirmed that a half-empty bottle of alcohol was found at the scene, 
        but no other drugs were present.
        The band announced that they had canceled the North American leg of their One More Light Tour following Bennington's death and that tickets would be refunded.</li>
      <li><strong>Funeral</strong> - Bennington's funeral was held at South Coast Botanic Garden in Palos Verdes, California, on July 29.
         In addition to his family members and close friends, 
         many musicians who toured or played with Linkin Park were also in attendance.
          The service also included a full stage for musical tributes. Bennington was cremated.</li>

        If a moment is all we are
        We're quicker, quicker
        Who cares if one more light goes out?
        Well I do"</p>
